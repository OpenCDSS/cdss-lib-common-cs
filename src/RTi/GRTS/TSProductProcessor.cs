	/// <summary>
	/// The TSProductProcessor class provides methods to query and process time series
	/// into output products (graphs, reports, etc.).  This interface is being phased in rather
	/// than extending the TSProcessor class.
	/// An example of implementation is as follows:
	/// <pre>
	/// try {
	///        TSProductProcessor p = new TSProcessor ();
	///		p.addTSSupplier ( this );
	///		p.processProduct ( "C:\\tmp\\Test.tsp", new PropList("x") );
	/// }
	/// catch ( Exception e ) {
	///		Message.printWarning ( 1, "TSToolMainGUI.test", "Error processing the product." );
	/// }
	/// </pre>
	/// </summary>
	public interface TSProductProcessor
	{

		/// <summary>
		/// Process the time series product. </summary>
		/// <param name="filename"> time series product file (*.tsp) </param>
		/// <param name="props"> run-time properties to control processing (in addition to *.tsp properties) </param>
		void processTSProduct(string filename, PropList props);
	}
