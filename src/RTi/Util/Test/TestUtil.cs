	/// 
	/// When a TestRunner starts up and is passed a class for which to run test methods,

	/// <a href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classforname.html">
	/// http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classforname.html</a>).  
	/// TestUtil then uses reflection to determine whether the instantiated class
	/// has a "suite()" method.  If the instantiated class does have
	/// a "suite()" method, that method is called and the tests returned from the method
	/// are added to the TestSuite.  This TestSuite is the object returned from

	/// classes within a SINGLE package.  Expanding it to allow running tests across
	/// multiple packages (provided all the packages' class files could be found under
	/// </para>
	/// the current working directory) would require the following, I think:<para>
	/// <pre>
	/// 1) Create a MultiPackageSuite class (for clarity) which takes a system property
	///   that can be one of those things:
	///   - an incomplete package (such as RTi.Util)
	///   - a set of comma-separate packages (such as RTi.Util.GUI,RTi.Util.String)
	/// 
	/// 2) Add code to TestUtil.  First, a method like "multiPackageSuite(Vector)". 
	///   The Vector is a parameter of Strings to match packages against.  This method
	///   should search all the directories under the current working directory (which
	///   must be in the classpath) or an alternate directory (provided it is in the 
	///   class path) and checks all the .class files it finds.  It first checks to see
	///   if the class has a suite() method.  If not, the class is skipped.  Next,
	///   it checks to see if the class is in a matching package.  If so, the class
	///   is added to the TestSuite to run.
	/// 
	/// 3) The assumption would be that when running multi-package tests, a developer
	///   cannot choose to run specific test classes or test methods.  All tests in 
	///   the selected packages are run at once.  If a multi-package test fails, 
	///   the developer will need to peg down to the specific class that is causing 
	///   errors and do development and testing within it. 
	/// </para>
	/// </pre><para>
	/// Overall, the above would be a bit of work, and probably only for the sake of
	/// RTiCore.  I'm honestly not 100% sure it's worth the time.

	REVISIT (JTS - 2006-06-07)
	RTi Messaging
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The code below uses the JUnit logging mechanism, and for that reason, output
	is printed with System.out.println() and exceptions with printStackTrace().
	
	However, we will want to enable the ability to log messages from classes into
	a regular RTi log file.  I have several ideas on this front, depending on 
	how we want to do this logging:
	
	1) Log to a single RTi log file for the duration of the entire test run.
	
	To do this would be relatively easy.  Since PackageSuite.suite() will be the
	entry point for collecting all the tests for a single package, it could be 
	extended to something like (pseudocode for now):
	
	public static void suite() {
		String packageName = System.getProperty("PACKAGE_NAME");
	
		if (packageName == null) {
			throw new Exception(
				"System property 'PACKAGE_NAME' must be set to the "
				+ "name of the package for which to execute unit "
				+ "tests.");
		}
	
		//----------------------
		Message.openLogFile(packageName + ".log");
		
		return TestUtil.suite(packageName);
	}
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	2) If we want to do a single RTi log file per test class, it would be a 
	bit more complicated, but it could be done.  We would rely on the automatic
	setUp() methods and the use of a utility class, like so:
	
	(the following would be contained within a test class)
	
	/--
	Whether the log file for this class has been opened.
	--/
	private static boolean __logFileOpened = false;
	
	/--
	The name of the log file to be written for this test class.
	-/
	private Static String __logName = "StringUtilTest.log";
	
	/--
	Called before a test is run.
	-/
	public void setUp() {
		if (!__logFileOpened) {
			Message.openLogFile(__logName);
			__logFileOpened = true;
		}
	}
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Note that in both the above examples, there is no way of knowing when to close
	the log file.   While it's possible to determine the first time that setUp()
	is called, it's not possible to determine the last time in a class that
	tearDown() will be called.  Likewise, when PackageSuite.suite() is called,
	that is the entry point into the testing, but there's no way to put hooks
	into when the testing is done. 
	
	A few things we could do about this:
	- in the finalize() method of the Message class, check for an open log file
	  and if one is found, close it cleanyl.
	- when a new log file is opened in Message, close the previous one.  
	  In fact, this might be done already.
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Finally, we will need some way to get the logging information into the
	log file opening (ie, to determine the levels at which debug, status, and
	warning are opened).  The most-easily configurable way, I feel, would
	be to pass this information into the testing framework via system properties
	(like how "PACKAGE_NAME" is used in PackageSuite).  
	
	This would require a change to the "test" target in the build files to something
	like this (note the 3 new <sysproperty> tags):
	
	<target name="test"
		depends="compile, compile_test"
		description="Runs the unit tests.">
	
		<junit 
			fork="yes">
			<classpath refid="classpath"/>
			<sysproperty
				key = "PACKAGE_NAME"
				value="${package}"/>
			<sysproperty
				key = "DEBUG_LEVEL"
				value="${debug_level}/>
			<sysproperty
				key = "STATUS_LEVEL"
				value="${status_level}/>
			<sysproperty
				key = "WARNING_LEVEL"
				value="${warning_level}/>
			<formatter 
				type="plain"/>
			<test 
				name="RTi.Util.Test.PackageSuite"
				todir="${test_results_dir}"
				outfile="UnitTestOutput-${TODAY}"/>
		</junit>
	</target>
	
	
	Then, in the top of the build.xml file, the levels for debug, status, and
	warning could be set like this:
	
	<property name="debug_level"	value="0"/>
	<property name="status_level"	value="2"/>
	<property name="warning_level"	value="1"/>
	
	Changing the values would require no recompilation, which is the benefit of
	doing it in this (slightly more complicated) way.

	- The ability to specify individual test methods in the test file.

	  First column is the list of TestClasses to execute, second column are the

		PropListTest	getValue
		PropListTest	setProp
		Command
	  
	  This would run tests in 3 classes, and would only run two test methods within

	- Given the way things are structured, might be able to assume that the only
