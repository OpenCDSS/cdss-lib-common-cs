	/// <summary>
	/// This interface must be implemented by any component that is to support drag
	/// and drop.  Certain Java components support drag and drop by default, such
	/// as JTextField, JPasswordField.  See this page for more information:<br>
	/// <blockquote>
	/// <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/dnd.html">
	/// How to Use Drag and Drop Data Transfer</a></blockquote><para>
	/// 
	/// In general, though, dragging is supported on the following components:<br>
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>JColorChooser</li>
	/// <li>JEditorPane</li>
	/// <li>JFileChooser</li>
	/// <li>JFormattedTextField</li>
	/// <li>JList</li>
	/// <li>JTable</li>
	/// <li>JTextArea</li>
	/// <li>JTextField</li>
	/// <li>JTextPane</li>
	/// <li>JTree</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// and dropping is supported on the following components:<br>
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>JColorChooser</li>
	/// <li>JEditorPane</li>
	/// <li>JFormattedTextField</li>
	/// <li>JPasswordField</li>
	/// <li>JTextArea</li>
	/// <li>JTextField</li>
	/// <li>JTextPane</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <b>Creating Drag-and-Droppable Components</b><para>
	/// Components that support being dragged and dropped must implement four
	/// interfaces:<br><ul>
	/// <li>DragGestureListener (Swing)</li>
	/// <li>DragSourceListener (Swing)</li>
	/// <li>DropTargetListener (Swing)</li>
	/// </para>
	/// <li>DragAndDrop (this interface)</li></ul><para>
	/// 
	/// These components must also have a member variable of type DragAndDropControl,
	/// which is used to store information about how drag and drop will be handled
	/// by the component.  This variable is necessary because Java interfaces are
	/// </para>
	/// not allowed to contain member variables..<para>
	/// 
	/// Most of the work done in drag and drop will be handled by the DragAndDropUtil 
	/// class.  The methods in this interface do not require anything in their method
	/// bodies, with the exception of getDataFlavors(), getDragAndDropControl(), 
	/// </para>
	/// getTransferable() and handleDropData().<para>
	/// 
	/// Components can be defined so that they support data being dragged out of them,
	/// data being dragged into them, or both.  Note that the text in editable text
	/// fields (such as JTextField) cannot be dragged out of the text fields.  
	/// </para>
	/// It is a known limitation of Java drag and drop.<para>
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <b>Constructor</b><para>
	/// 
	/// The constructor of the class must create an instance of a DragAndDropControl 
	/// member variable and populate it with the details of how the component 
	/// responds to drag and drop actions.  See the DragAndDropControl Javadocs for 
	/// </para>
	/// details.<para>
	/// 
	/// The constructor must also build a DragSource, a DropTarget, or both 
	/// (depending on how the component will work), and
	/// put them into the DragAndDropControl object.  The following code demonstrates a 
	/// </para>
	/// sample constructor:<para>
	/// <blockquote><pre>
	/// public GenericConstructor(boolean allowDrag, boolean allowDrop, int dragAction,
	/// int dropAction) {
	/// __data = new DragAndDropControl(allowDrag, allowDrop, dragAction, 
	///		dropAction);
	/// if (allowDrag) {
	///		__data.setDragSource(
	///			DragAndDropUtil.createDragSource(this, dragAction, 
	///			this));
	/// }
	/// if (allowDrop) {
	///		__data.setDropTarget(
	///			DragAndDropUtil.createDropTarget(this, dropAction, 
	///			this));
	/// }
	/// }
	/// </pre></blockquote>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <b>Starting a Drag, Ending a Drop</b><para>
	/// 
	/// The mouse action that defines when a drag begins and when a drop ends will vary
	/// from system to system, but in general, a drag begins when the user presses the
	/// mouse button down on a component and holds it down, and then moves the mouse
	/// cursor away from the component.  A drop occurs when the user -- still holding
	/// down the mouse button -- moves the mouse cursor over another component and 
	/// </para>
	/// releases the button.<para>
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <b>Drag and Drop Action</b><para>
	/// 
	/// Drag and drop actions are defined in DragAndDropUtil.  Drag actions refer to 
	/// what the component should do after data are dragged out of it.  Drop actions 
	/// </para>
	/// refer to what the component should do when data are dragged into it.<para>
	/// 
	/// </para>
	/// <b>Responding to a Successful Drag</b><para>
	/// 
	/// When a drag is successful, the drag component will receive a call via this
	/// interface to dragSuccessful(int action).  The action tells the drag component
	/// the action that the component onto which data was dropped responded to.  The
	/// drag component should check that action and, using the table below, treat its
	/// data appropriately.  The drop component doesn't need to worry about what the
	/// action was.  If the drag was successful, the drop component need only copy
	/// the data into itself.  The drag component will worry about what should happen
	/// </para>
	/// to the original data.<para>
