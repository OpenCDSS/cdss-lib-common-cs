	/// <summary>
	/// Base class from which other classes that are to be used as cell renderers in 
	/// the JWorksheet should be built, as it provides a getWidths() routine (which 
	/// is used by JWorksheet) if the other classes do not.  If a JTable is not
	/// assigned a specific cell renderer, this one will do the job.<para>
	/// </para>
	/// REVISIT (JTS - 2006-05-25)<para>
	/// If I could do this over again, I would have combined AbstractTableCellRenderer,
	/// DefaultTableCellRenderer and AbstractExcelCellRenderer into a single cell 
	/// renderer.  The reasoning for having the separation came about from the 
	/// </para>
	/// way the JWorksheet was designed originally.<para>
	/// AbstractTableCellRenderer was supposed to be The Base Class for all other 
	/// </para>
	/// renderers, providing the basic outline of what they would do.<para>
	/// DefaultTableCellRenderer was supposed to be used for worksheets that didn't
	/// </para>
	/// require any special cell formatting.<para>
	/// AbstractExcelCellRenderer was supposed to be the base class for cell renderers
	/// </para>
	/// that would do formatting of cell contents.<para>
	/// </para>
	/// In theory.<para>
	/// In practice, ALL cell renderers are doing cell formatting, so the 
	/// AbstractTableCellRenderer and DefaultTableCellRenderer are unnecessary overhead.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// </para>
	/// <b>Also</b><para>
	/// I really don't see much of a good reason to even REQUIRE cell renderers for
	/// most classes.  There are a lot of cell renderers out there that are almost 100%
	/// the same class.  At this point there's little chance of going back and 
	/// eliminating them, but if I could I would.  Use a default cell renderer for all
	/// those classes and eliminate a lot of maintenance woes.
