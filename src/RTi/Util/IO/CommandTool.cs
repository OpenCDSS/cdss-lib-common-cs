	/// <summary>
	/// This interface should be implemented by Command classes that offer interactive
	/// running of the command (e.g., a Tools menu option).  For example, a command may
	/// be implemented to process a file.  The tool allows the user to interactively run
	/// the command.  The GUI for the command and the tool are essentially the same,
	/// except that the OK button for the command editor results in a text form of the
	/// command, whereas the OK button for the tool will run the command.  To run the
	/// command, the Tool should rely on the normal command methods like
	/// checkCommandParameters().
	/// </summary>

	/// <param name="parent"> the parent JFrame to which the command editor will be a child. </param>
	/// <returns> true if the command was run (e.g., "OK" was pressed) or false if the
	/// command was not edited (e.g., "Cancel" was pressed). </returns>
