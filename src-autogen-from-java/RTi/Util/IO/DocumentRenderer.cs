/// Revisions
/// 2007-04-17	Kurt Tometich, RTi		Added some methods to format the

/// 									because the original print scale function
/// 									was based on image scaling.  This caused the
/// 									image to shrink to an unreadable size.  The
/// 									functions added change HTML style and line
/// 									length to provide a more readable,

	/*  DocumentRenderer prints objects of type Document. Text attributes, including
	    fonts, color, and icons, will be rendered to a printed page.
	    DocumentRenderer computes line breaks, paginates, and performs other
	    formatting.
	
	    An HTMLDocument is printed by sending it as an argument to the
	    print(HTMLDocument) method. A PlainDocument is printed the same way. Other
	    types of documents must be sent in a JEditorPane as an argument to the
	    print(JEditorPane) method. Printing Documents in this way will automatically
	    display a print dialog.  
	
	    As objects which implement the Printable Interface, instances of the
	    DocumentRenderer class can also be used as the argument in the setPrintable
	    method of the PrinterJob class. Instead of using the print() methods
	    detailed above, a programmer may gain access to the formatting capabilities
	    of this class without using its print dialog by creating an instance of
	    DocumentRenderer and setting the document to be printed with the
	    setDocument() or setJEditorPane(). The Document may then be printed by
	    setting the instance of DocumentRenderer in any PrinterJob.

	///    The print method implements the Printable interface. Although Printables
	///    may be called to render a page more than once, each page is painted in
	///    order; therefore, keep track of changes in the page being rendered
	///    by setting the currentPage variable to equal the pageIndex, and then
	///    comparing these variables on subsequent calls to this method. When the two
	///    variables match, it means that the page is being rendered for the second or
	///    third time. When the currentPage differs from the pageIndex, a new page is
	///    being requested.
	/// 
	///    The highlights of the process used print a page are as follows:
	/// 
	///    I.    The Graphics object is cast to a Graphics2D object to allow for
	///          scaling.
	///    II.   The JEditorPane is laid out using the width of a printable page.
	///          This will handle line breaks. If the JEditorPane cannot be sized at
	///          the width of the graphics clip, scaling will be allowed.
	///    III.  The root view of the JEditorPane is obtained. By examining this root
	///          view and all of its children, printView will be able to determine
	///          the location of each printable element of the document.
	///    IV.   If the scaleWidthToFit option is chosen, a scaling ratio is
	///          determined, and the graphics2D object is scaled.
	///    V.    The Graphics2D object is clipped to the size of the printable page.
	///    VI.   currentPage is checked to see if this is a new page to render. If so,
	///          pageStartY and pageEndY are reset.
	///    VII.  To match the coordinates of the printable clip of graphics2D and the
	///          allocation rectangle which will be used to lay out the views,
	///          graphics2D is translated to begin at the printable X and Y
	///          coordinates of the graphics clip.
	///    VIII. An allocation Rectangle is created to represent the layout of the
	///          Views.
	/// 
	///          The Printable Interface always prints the area indexed by reference
	///          to the Graphics object. For instance, with a standard 8.5 x 11 inch
	///          page with 1 inch margins the rectangle X = 72, Y = 72, Width = 468,
	///          and Height = 648, the area 72, 72, 468, 648 will be painted regardless
	///          of which page is actually being printed.
	/// 
	///          To align the allocation Rectangle with the graphics2D object two
	///          things are done. The first step is to translate the X and Y
	///          coordinates of the graphics2D object to begin at the X and Y
	///          coordinates of the printable clip, see step VII. Next, when printing
	///          other than the first page, the allocation rectangle must start laying
	///          out in coordinates represented by negative numbers. After page one,
	///          the beginning of the allocation is started at minus the page end of
	///          the prior page. This moves the part which has already been rendered to
	///          before the printable clip of the graphics2D object.
	/// 
	///    X.    The printView method is called to paint the page. Its return value
	///          will indicate if a page has been rendered.
