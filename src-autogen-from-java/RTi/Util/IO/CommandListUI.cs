	/// This interface provides methods to allow code to interact with a UI for a command list, beyond the
	/// basic actions of the command list model (whatever is implemented).  For example, a method is included
	/// to request the insert position for a command.  This may be indicated by selections in a UI, whereas the
	/// basic list model does not know about UI state.  It is expected that this interface will remain fairly simple
	/// but may grow over time.
