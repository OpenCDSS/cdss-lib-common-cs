	/// <summary>
	/// Run the command in discovery mode.  A partial read of data will occur.  This is useful when
	/// editing commands (after committing the edit).  Because the data for a command may not be fully
	/// available at edit time (e.g., input file may not exist), a discovery run may produce less
	/// (or no) output than a full run.
	/// The ObjectListProvider can then be implemented to retrieve a list of data objects from the read.
	/// The parameters are the same as the Command.runCommand() method. </summary>
	/// <param name="command_index"> The number of the command 0+.  When used with a processor,
	/// this can be used to cross-reference the command to a log, etc.  Pass -1 if a
	/// valid command number cannot be determined. </param>
