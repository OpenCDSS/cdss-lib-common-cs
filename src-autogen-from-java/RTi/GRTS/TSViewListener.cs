// TSViewListener - listener to communicate between TS Views
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// History:
//
// 24 Jun 1999	Steven A. Malers, RTi	Implemented code.
// 2002-01-17	SAM, RTi		Change name from TSViewListener to
//					TSViewListenerNoSwing to allow support
//					for Swing components.  Update the
//					methods to pass TSGraphNoSwing that the
//					event occurred in (this supports
//					multiple graphs on the same
//					TSGraphCanvas and will allow the data
//					limits for other drawing areas to be
//					reset).  Change so that GRShape is used
//					rather than GRLimits (similar to
//					RTi.GIS.GeoView.GeoViewListenerNoSwing).
// ===============================
// 2002-11-11	SAM, RTi		Copy AWT version and convert to Swing.
// 2003-06-03	SAM, RTi		Minor update - now using full Swing
//					TSGraphJComponent.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
